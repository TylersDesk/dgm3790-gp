### Steps to setup project:

First you'll need to grab the repository, this will get all the necesarry files.
+ `git clone https://github.com/TylersDesk/dgm3790-gp.git`

Change directory into the newly downloaded folder. `cd dgm3790-gp`.

Now you will need to switch to the develop branch. As this has the latest changes, if you don't do this you may not get all of the latest edits I have made.

+ `git checkout -f develop`

Next you need to `npm install`. This reads the package.json and installs node modules

+ `npm install`

Now you can simply tell node to run the server:

+ `node app.js`

You should see the server running. If you don't check the following steps above. Go check out the app:

+ `http:\\www.localhost.com:3000`
